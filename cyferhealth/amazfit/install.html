<h2>Install Zepp from the Google Play Store</h2>
<p>1. Once installed, click Open.</p>
<img style="margin:20px 20px 60px;border:2px solid black;width:30%" src="z1.jpg" alt="Family" >
<p>2. You need to log into the Zepp system. You can sign in with an account you may already have ("Sign in with a third-party account") or just create a random email address and password ("Create an account now"). With the latter, you will reach the "Sign up" page. The email address isn't checked that it exists but if you ever want to move the AmazFit settings to a different device, make sure you remember the address and password. When completing this page, don't miss the country selection at the top of the page, depending on the size of your phone's display, it may have scrolled off the top.</p>

<img style="margin:20px 20px 60px;border:2px solid black;width:30%" src="z3.jpg" alt="Family" >
<p>3. Enter the requested information. Cyfer Health doesn't use (or have access to) any of this information but if you want to use the functions of the Zepp app, it is best to enter correct information.</p>

<p>4. You now need to approve a few permission requests.</p>

<p>5. The next stage is to pair (i.e. connect) the band to your phone. Tap "Profile", "Add device" and "Band". (Make sure the band is close to your phone.) Now Zepp will try to find your band. If it is successful, the band will vibrate and you will need to click the <em>band</em> to confirm that you wish to pair it. (You might need your glasses for this bit because the message on the band is very small.)</p>

<img style="margin:20px 20px 60px;border:2px solid black;width:30%" src="Inkedz7.jpg" alt="Family" >
<img style="margin:20px 20px 60px;border:2px solid black;width:30%" src="Inkedz8.jpg" alt="Family" >
<p>6. You may find that the band's software needs to be updated. Keep the band close to your phone and wait until the update has finished.</p>
<img style="margin:20px 20px 60px;border:2px solid black;width:30%" src="z9.jpg" alt="Family" >
<p>7. You should now see the following screen with various settings. Scroll down until you can see the ringed settings and change the settings to match the ringed values.</p>
<img style="margin:20px 20px 60px;border:2px solid black;width:30%" src="z10.jpg" alt="Family" >
<img style="margin:20px 20px 60px;border:2px solid black;width:30%" src="Inkedz11.jpg" alt="Family" >
<p>Scroll down further until you can see the following settings, and change them to match the ringed values. To change the Health Monitoring setting, you need to tap it and then you will be taken to the Health Monitoring settings page.</p>


<img style="margin:20px 20px 60px;border:2px solid black;width:30%" src="Inkedz12.jpg" alt="Family" >
<img style="margin:20px 20px 60px;border:2px solid black;width:30%" src="Inkedz13.jpg" alt="Family" >
<p>Now, go back until you reach the following screen. Tap Settings and change the ringed setting.</p>
<img style="margin:20px 20px 60px;border:2px solid black;width:30%" src="Inkedz14.jpg" alt="Family" >
<img style="margin:20px 20px 60px;border:2px solid black;width:30%" src="Inkedz15.jpg" alt="Family" >
<p>Zepp should now be configured to work with Cyfer Health. The final step is to configure Cyfer Health.
