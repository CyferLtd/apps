<h2>Cyfer BLE Tx - BLE Format</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Using your watch's Bluetooth capabilities (BLE), broadcast your heart rate to devices such as gym and medical equipment. The heart rate readings are transmitted using an open standard so should work with most equipment without any configuration. Just tap the app's On button (middle of the screen), accept all the permissions and you will be broadcasting your heart rate. (While you are wearing your watch!)
Optionally,your step count and GPS location can be broadcast, however, this does not use open standards. See the Technical section, below, for further details.</p>
