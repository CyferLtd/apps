<h2>Cyfer Health app installation</h2>
<p>As well as the Cyfer Health app, you will need a compatible health band. Currently, only the Xiaomi Mi Smart Band 5, the Xiaomi Mi Smart Band 6 and the Amazfit Band 5 are compatible. The prices of the bands vary considerably but you should aim to pay around £20 for the 5s and £30 for the 6. With regards the Cyfer Health app, there is no advantage with going for the more expensive Band 6.</p>
<p>Once you have obtained the Xiaomi or Amazfit band, you need to install its software. For Xiaomi the software is called Mi Fit and for AmazFit it's called Zepp. Both can be found on the Google Play Store:
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xiaomi.hm.health"><img src="mifit.png" alt="Mi Fit"  width="30">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xiaomi.hm.health</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.huami.watch.hmwatchmanager"><img src="zepp.png" alt="Zepp"  width="30">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.huami.watch.hmwatchmanager</a>.</p>
<p> (The Cyfer Health app communicates with these apps which, in turn, communicates with the band.)</p> 
<p>For Mi Fit, follow these <a href="mifit.html">steps</a> and for Zepp, follow these <a href="amazfit/install.html">steps.</a></p>
