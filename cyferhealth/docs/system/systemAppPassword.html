<h1>Cyfer Health System Set-up</h1>
<h3>Cyfer Health's Document Terminology</h3>
<p><i>Patient</i> is the person being looked after. Unless you are a professional carer you probably don't think of this person as a 'patient' but instead they are a relative or a friend to whom you feel responsible, in some way, for their welfare.</p>
<p><i>Carer</i> is the person looking after the <i>patient</i>. This documentation assumes that the reader is the <i>Carer</i> so when 'you' is used, it is referring to the role of the <i>Carer</i>.</p>
<p>There will often be more than one <i>Carer</i>, e.g. siblings looking after a parent; and within a health care organisation there is likely to be a large number of <i>Carers</i>. Likewise, within such a care organisation, there are likely to be a large number of <i>Patients</i>.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Before installing and configuring Cyfer Health, the following are required.</p>
<p>
Every patient will need:
<ul>
<li>a health band. The choice of health band to use is left to you. You can choose one from the compatibility list (<a href="./compatiblebands.html" style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">see here</a>) or experiment with another one and see if you can get it to work. (See 
<a href="https://cyferorg.github.io/CyferHealth/docs/client/settingsadvanced.html" style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">here</a> for some hints.)
It is strongly recommended that a band that has a long battery life is chosen (weeks rather than hours) so that the patient does not need to be continually charging the battery or you (the carer) needing to go around to the patient's house to do the charging. Also, one that is relatively cheap so that it does not matter if it gets damaged or lost.</li>
<li>(optional) a Bluetooth 'button' to be used as the emergency button. (Google 'bluetooth shutter release' for such buttons. You shouldn't spend more than a few pounds on the device. You may already have one in a drawer!) A button is only required if the emergency button functionality is required.
<li>a new Google email address and app password. (In the future other email addresses may be usable but at the moment it must be a Google email.) This must be a new email address and not one that is currently being used by the patient or anyone else. A new Google account should be created in order to generate a new Google email address. As well as the Google email address an app password from the same Google account must be created. The app password is generated by Google and always (at least at the time of writing) consists of 16 letters. The email address will be something like johnjones527@gmail.com and the app password will be something like fraeyeaxpwefyuqz i.e 16 letters.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The carers (or the organisation delivering the caring service) will need a new Google email address and app password but they will all share the same address and password.
As an example, if there are two patients Arthur and Jane, and two carers Emma and Mark:
<ul>
<li>Arthur would require a new Google account and have something like, email address: arthur353719@gmail.com and app password: fraeyeaxpwefyuqz</li>
<li>Jane would require a new Google account and have something like, email address: jane24418@gmail.com and app password: xewqugrybwesfgum</li>
<li>Emma and Mark would share a new Google account and have something like, email address arthurchild252@gmail.com and app password: ywecwzxpijytvewk</li>
</ul>
<p>If one or more carers only requires receiving alerts and daily summaries (i.e. not access to the real-time monitoring information) then nothing is required. Instead, the carer's current email address can be used to receive the alerts and daily summaries.<p>
<p>Instructions for setting up the Google accounts and app password can be found <a href="https://cyferltd.github.io/apps/cyferhealth/gmailsetup.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">here</a>. However, the instructions may be out of date by the time you read this document. If that is the case, please try Googling for instructions but if you get stuck, send an email to cyferltd@gmail.com.<p>
<h3>Configuring the health band</h3>
<p>Most 'medical' type heart monitors (e.g chest straps, fingertip pulse monitors) typically don't require any configuration before being used with Cyfer Health, however, they may not be convenient for continuous (24 hour) use. Most 'lifestyle' devices, typically wrist bands/watches, come with a companion app that is downloaded from the Google PlayStore. Make sure you install this app on the patient's phone and get the device working with that app before trying to configure the device with Cyfer Health. Once the app is working with the device, there will probably be further configuration required in the app to allow the app to share its readings (heart rate, foot steps etc) with another app (Cyfer Health in this case). <a href="https://cyferltd.github.io/apps/cyferhealth/amazfit/install.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0,0,255)">See here</a> for an example of setting up an app to share readings with Cyfer Health.</p>

<p>The amount of data sent from the client to the monitor is typically around 6MB (megabytes) per day. If you don't have an unlimited network connection, make sure you factor this cost into your calculations. The amount of data sent from the monitor to a small number of clients is around 16MB per day.</p>
