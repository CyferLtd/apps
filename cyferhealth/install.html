<h2>Cyfer Health app installation</h2>
<p>As well as the Cyfer Health app, you will need a compatible health band. Currently, only the Xiaomi Mi Smart Band 5 and the Xiaomi Mi Smart Band 6 are compatible. The prices of the bands vary considerably but you should aim to pay around £20 for the 5 and £30 for the 6. With regards the Cyfer Health app, there is no advantage with going for the more expensive Band 6 though it does have additional functions and a better screen, which may be of interest.</p>
<p>Once you have the Xiaomi band, you need to install Xiaomi's software, Mi Fit, which you obtain from the Google Play Store:
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xiaomi.hm.health"><img src="mifit.png" alt="Mi Fit"  width="30">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xiaomi.hm.health</a> (The Cyfer Health app communicates with the Mi Fit app which, in turn, communicates with the band.) Follow the Mi Fit instructions to get your band connected. Detailed instructions for Band 5, which has slightly different screenshots to Band 6, can be found <a href="../cyferhealthdad/install.html">here</a> but you shouldn't need them to get the connection to the band working. However, there are some critical Mi Fit settings that need to be made in order for the Cyfer Health app to work with Mi Fit. Once Mi Fit is connected to your band, check the following settings.</p>
<p>Within the Mi Fit app, go to the <em>Profile</em> tab. Then tap the label showing your band.</p>

<p>Scroll down until you can see the settings shown in the second of the following screenshots, and make sure that your settings match the ringed settings. If they don't, change them.</p> 
<p>Once you have ensured those settings match the screenshot, tap on <em>Health monitoring</em>.</p>

<img style="margin:20px 20px 60px;border:2px solid black;width:30%" src="Inked3.jpg" alt="Family" >
<p>Finally, check that your settings match the two ringed settings.</p>
<img style="margin:20px 20px 60px;border:2px solid black;width:30%" src="Inked4.jpg" alt="Family" >

<p>Your band and Mi Fit should now be ready to connect to the Cyfer Health app.</p>
<h2>Configuring the Cyfer Health app</h2>
<p>Cyfer Health uses GMail to communicate. Whilst, any GMail account could be used, it is best to create a dedicated GMail account for Cyfer Health. (Using a dedicated account removes any concerns around privacy and possible bugs that might alter/delete emails in an existing GMail account.) Create such an account, choose Two Factor Authentication, and create an application specific password to be used by Cyfer Health. Detailed steps showing how to do this can be found <a href="gmailsetup.html">here</a></p>
<p>Once you have the GMail information, start the Cyfer Health app. You should be taken to the settings screen. If not, or you have a need to make changes at a later date, tap the gear icon in the top right corner.</p>
<p>First, specify whether you will be running Cyfer Health in stand-alone mode. If the app will be running at part of an organisation-wide Cyfer Health installation with a central Cyfer Health email address then make sure stand-alone mode is not enabled. If you will be running Cyfer Health with just one person being monitored and with one or more individuals receiving the alerts, make sure stand-alone mode is selected.</p>
<img style="margin:20px 20px 60px;border:2px solid black;width:30%" src="settingsnotstandalone.png" alt="Family" >
<img style="margin:20px 20px 60px;border:2px solid black;width:30%" src="standalonesettings.png" alt="Family" >
<p>Now, depending on the mode of operation, enter the following information:</p>
<h2>Not running in stand-alone mode</h2>
<ul style="font-size:20">
<li>The name of the person wearing the band and whose health is to be monitored. (This can have any value.)
<li>The GMail email address that you have just created.
<li>The GMail app password that you have just created. (Make sure you enter the app password and not the GMail account password.)
<li>The email address of the Cyfer Health server.
<li>Optionally, any email addresses of recipients who wish to receive daily health summaries and alerts. (Seperate multiple addresses with a comma.) This is optional, because alerts will also be received by anyone with access to the Cyfer Health monitoring app.
<li>Select the required heart rate values (high and low) that specify when an alert should be raised to the above optional addresses. (There is more granularity of alert setting within the Cyfer Health Monitor app.)
<li>Identify the band that is to be monitored by tapping its entry in the list of all the currently detected Bluetooth devices. The band's entry in the list will become bold. If you select the wrong entry, just tap the correct one.
</ul> 
<h2>Stand-alone mode</h2>
<ul style="font-size:20">
<li>The name of the person wearing the band and whose health is to be monitored. (This can have any value.)
<li>The GMail email address that you have just created.
<li>The GMail app password that you have just created. (Make sure you enter the app password and not the GMail account password.)
<li>The email addresses of the recipients of the daily health summaries and  alerts. (Seperate multiple addresses with a comma.)
<li>Select the required heart rate values (high and low) that specify when an alert should be raised.
<li>Identify the band that is to be monitored by tapping its entry in the list of all the currently detected Bluetooth devices. The band's entry in the list will become bold. If you select the wrong entry, just tap the correct one.
</ul> 
<p>By tapping the padlock icon at the top of the screen, it is possible to lock this settings screen so that the settings can't be changed. If this restriction is desired, tap the padlock and specify a 4 digit pin that will be required to re-enter this screen. If you ever wish to remove the lock, enter the pin: <em>0000</em>.</p>
<p>Tap the checkbox at the top of the screen to test the settings. Whenever you change any of the email related settings, you will be required to initiate this test before leaving the settings screen.</p>
<p>To exit the app and stop monitoring the band, tap the red power button.</p>
<h2>Android configuration</h2>
<p>Depending on which version of Android you are using and how it is configured, you may find that Cyfer Health gets terminated after a few hours of use. To prevent this, go into Android's app settings, find the entry for Cyfer Health and turn off battery optimisation.</p>
